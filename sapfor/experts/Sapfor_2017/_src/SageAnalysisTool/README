This file contains PRELIMINARY extensions to the basic sage system.
It mainly consists in an interface with the Omega test.
A demo program using the functionnalities of this library is given in
DemoDataDep. Documentation for this library is not yet available.


This directory contains the following files:


 Makefile		: just do make: create the library libDep.a

 OmegaForSage		: directory containing the Omega test src code

 annotationDriver.C/.h	: Interface in sage with the annotation system

 arrayRef.C/.h		: routine to create sets of array references  (no yet completed)
   			  give the index in  affine form when possible
